FOLDER GUIDE

Madapenguins – code – inside this folder you will find two folders:

-	ResNet50 – Final Model.ipynb is the code about our final best model which gave us 0.51 score on Codabench platform.
-	Other attempts folder – containing 11 files:
  - Bigger Augmentation Attempt - InceptionV3.ipynb is the file about the 6.1 section of our report.
  - 4 files about MiniCNNs – section 6.2 of our report.
    - MiniCNN - CNN 1.0.ipynb and  MiniCNN - CNN 1.1.ipynb are about the first Mini CNN attempt.
    - Mini CNN – CNN 2.0 Resnet.ipynb is about the second Mini CNN attempt.
    - Mini CNN – CNN 3.0 Inception.ipynb is about the third Mini CNN attempt.
    - Mini CNN – other attempt Inception.ipynb is another attempt Mini CNN. It isn’t in the report, and it’s built with Inception blocks.
  - 2 files about ResNet50 - starting codes about our final model.
  - 3 files about the other pretrained models we considered.
-	Final model folder – containing 1 folder:
o	Preprocessing folder – containing 2 files about the preprocessing of our final model:
  - Dataset_investigation.ipynb (preprocessing part 1) – first dataset analysis
  - Outlier detection (preprocessing parte 2) – removing duplicates and outliers
