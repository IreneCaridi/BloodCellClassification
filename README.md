FOLDER GUIDE

Madapenguins – code – inside this folder you will find two folders:

o	ResNet50 – Final Model.ipynb is the code about our final best model which gave us 0.51 score on Codabench platform.
-	Other attempts folder – containing 11 files:
o	Bigger Augmentation Attempt - InceptionV3.ipynb is the file about the 6.1 section of our report.
o	5 files about MiniCNNs – section 6.2 of our report.
MiniCNN - CNN 1.0.ipynb and  MiniCNN - CNN 1.1.ipynb are about the first Mini CNN attempt.
Mini CNN – CNN 2.0 Resnet.ipynb is about the second Mini CNN attempt.
Mini CNN – CNN 3.0 Inception.ipynb is about the third Mini CNN attempt.
Mini CNN – other attempt Inception.ipynb is another attempt Mini CNN. It isn’t in the report, and it’s built with Inception blocks.
o	2 files about ResNet50 - starting codes about our final model.
o	3 files about the other pretrained models we considered.
-	Final model folder – containing 1 folder:
o	Preprocessing folder – containing 4 files about the preprocessing of our final model:
	training_set.npz is our dataset.
	training_set_cleaned.npz is our preprocessed dataset (applying preprocessing part 1 - 2)
	Dataset_investigation.ipynb (preprocessing part 1) – first dataset analysis
	Outlier detection (preprocessing parte 2) – removing duplicates and outliers
